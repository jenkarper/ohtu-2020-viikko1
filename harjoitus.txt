Promise me no promises
so will I not promise you
Keep we both our liberty
never false, never true
Let us keep the die uncast
free to come as free to go
for I cannot know your past
and of mine what can you know?

If you promised
you might grieve
for lost liberty again
If I promised
I believe
I should fret to break the chain
